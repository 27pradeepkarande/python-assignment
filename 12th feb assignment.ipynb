    "2. What happens when a exception is not handled ? Explain with example\n",
    "ans :- When an exception is not handled in Python, the program will crash. This is because the exception will propagate        up the call stack until it reaches the top level, where it will be raised. The Python interpreter will then              generate a traceback, which is a stack trace of where the exception occurred.\n",
