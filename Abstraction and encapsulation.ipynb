    "4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "ans :- In short, data abstraction in programming is achieved by:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      -Using classes and objects to represent abstract data types.\n",
    "      -Encapsulating data by making attributes private and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
    "      -Employing abstract classes and interfaces to define a common interface for related classes.\n",

    "5. can we create an instances of an abstrast class?Explain your Answer.\n",
    "ans :-  You cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. Abstract classes are meant to be subclassed, \n",
    "        and instances should be created from concrete subclasses that provide implementations for all abstract methods."
